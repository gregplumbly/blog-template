title: Thomas Miers’ festive spiced nuts recipe

Spiced nuts are the perfect accompaniment to a sloe cocktail or any other drink you like to sip in the run-up to Christmas. Smoky, and lightly spiced with a touch of gentle sweetness, they are completely irresistible, and a much healthier alternative to crisps.

If you’re panicking about entertaining and timings in the kitchen over the holiday season then this is the perfect solution. The recipe is straightforward, using some basic spices you probably already have in your store cupboard. Tossed in spicy, aromatic and salty flavouring these nuts will have lovely whole spices such as cumin and fennel seeds clinging to the surface alongside pimentón or cayenne to provide a sweet, smokey rounded flavour.
