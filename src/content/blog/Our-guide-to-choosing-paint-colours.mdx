title: Our guide to choosing paint colours
---

When it comes to choosing colours for your home, it can be an overwhelming decision. Luckily, two of the most reputable names in the interiors world are here to help. Edward Bulmer, one of the foremost colour experts and interior designers working today, founded his eponymous natural paint brand to help a dirty paint industry clean up its act, and comes with 35 years of experience in using colour and paint with confidence and clarity. Matching his advice is industry icon, Rita Konig. Often referred to as the queen of ‘undone’ interiors, Rita’s design approach mixes high style with unfussy restraint; her approach to colour and pattern is bold and full of character.
